## BasicJS && AdvancedJS

```
/* A list of various basic JavaScript projects,
 * which I subsequently rewrote using React to enhance functionality and performance.
 *
 * These projects include practical applications like calculators, form validation,
 * and custom countdown timers, showcasing my ability to implement fundamental JavaScript
 * concepts and then scale them with React.
 *
 * Additionally, I have also created projects where I experimented further by
 * incorporating additional tools and technologies.
 *
 * These projects started with basic JavaScript, were rewritten with React, and then
 * extended with various utilities to explore new possibilities and improve functionality
 * resulting in more dynamic and comprehensive web applications.
